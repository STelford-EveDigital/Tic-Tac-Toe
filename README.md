## Naughts & Crosses (TicTacToe)

Naughts & Crosses is a two player game where each player takes turns to mark a square (X/O) and attempt to get three in a row.
To play, users will need to create an account and head over to the dashboard to either create a new game or join an existing game.

The project is set up with Laravel 11, Inertia w/ Vue and uses Laravel Breeze for user authentication and account creation.
